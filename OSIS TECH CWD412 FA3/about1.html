        <h2>Main challenge</h2>
        <p>The inception of CTU-Buddy can be traced back to a shared frustration among our founding members.</p>
        <p>As students ourselves, we often found it cumbersome to manage the various documents, assignments, and resources required throughout our academic pursuits.</p>
        <p>We recognized the need for a centralized platform that could streamline these processes and enhance communication within the campus community.</p>
        <p>Our brainstorming sessions, fueled by late-night study sessions and countless cups of coffee, led us to envision a comprehensive website that would revolutionize student life on campus.</p>
        <p>The idea was simple yet powerful: create a virtual "buddy" that students could rely on for quick access to document uploads, announcements, and a direct line of communication with university departments.</p>
